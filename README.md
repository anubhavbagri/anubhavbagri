## Hello there 👋
I love solving complex problems through technology and building high-quality software that makes a meaningful impact. With experience in Java, React, Flutter, and Azure cloud, I have worked across the frontend and backend, developing scalable applications, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and automating workflows using Docker and GitHub Actions.

I thrive on problem-solving, data structures and algorithms (DSA), continuously sharpening my skills through hands-on projects and competitive coding. Beyond my professional work, I actively participate in hackathons, where I enjoy tackling real-world challenges through innovative solutions.
### Summary 👨‍
- 🔭 I’m constantly trying to improve my concepts of Data Structures.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning System Design.
- 💻 I love designing be it graphics or UI. You can check my portfolio here : [Behance](https://www.behance.net/anubhavbagri)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on project ideas and participate actively in hackathons.
- 💬 Ask me anything. I'll be glad to help.
